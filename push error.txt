Your error message indicates that your local java branch is behind the remote java branch. This usually happens when new changes have been added to the remote branch, and you need to fetch and merge them before pushing.

Steps to Fix the Issue
1Ô∏è‚É£ Pull the Latest Changes First
Since the error message suggests to "fetch first," run:

sh
Copy
Edit
git pull origin java --rebase
This pulls the latest changes from the remote java branch and applies your commits on top of it.

üîπ If there are conflicts, resolve them, then continue the rebase:

sh
Copy
Edit
git rebase --continue
2Ô∏è‚É£ Push Your Changes Again
Once the pull (rebase) is successful, push your changes:

sh
Copy
Edit
git push origin java
Alternative Solution (If You Want to Overwrite Remote)
‚ö†Ô∏è Use this only if you are sure you want to overwrite the remote branch!

sh
Copy
Edit
git push --force origin java
This will forcefully push your changes and overwrite the remote branch, discarding any remote changes. Use with caution!

Why Did This Happen?
Someone else pushed changes to java on GitHub.
You made changes locally and tried to push without first pulling.
Git prevents non-fast-forward pushes to avoid accidental data loss.
